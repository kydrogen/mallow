# What is this
- This is a prototype sample --not the actual prototype
- Python code with simplified implementation
- Why are we doing this?
  - Given situation
  - **Problem**: The innovation project is not well understood or seems too simple and similar to existing chatbot. 

  - **Design**: Create an interactive prototype to address this issue since it worked well for the robot design. 

- Goal: 
  - Take inspiration from this and complete the design and iteration cycle, use it to effectively communicate the solution  
  - Expose to programming with AI

# Prototype Code Example
This is an example implementation of how an AI Agent is used --not just the implementation of an agent. Key parts are:
1. Interaction - how to engage with the agent, is it 
2. Agent - how the Agent is created
   - System Prompt
   - LMM
   - Tools
3. Data Repository - how the Agent uses the data repository
4. Output - how the Agent display the output
   - access (who can access the Agent)
   - filter (what data the Agent should show)
   - formatting (how to show specific data --location should not be precise, just vague area)
